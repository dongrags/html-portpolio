<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
   I am an aspiring web developer with a passion for creating engaging, user-centric websites. 
   Currently, i am dedicating my time and energy to honing my skills in the ever-evolving world of web 
   development. Though relatively early in my journey, i am enthusiasm for design, layout, and user 
   experience has already driven me to explore various front-end technologies and frameworks.

  Over the past months, i was gained practical experience building and styling websites, 
  focusing primarily on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. He has designed responsive interfaces,
  implemented interactive features, and optimized layouts for different devices—all while staying mindful 
  of modern design principles. Although comfortable crafting the look and feel of a site, i am recognizes 
  that my knowledge of back-end processes, server-side languages, and database management remains limited.

  Moving forward, my goal is to deepen my understanding of the “behind-the-scenes” code that 
  powers dynamic websites. My plans is to explore back-end technologies such as Html, CSS Java script, Node.js or 
  Python, learn how APIs function, and become familiar with database systems like MySQL or MongoDB. By bridging the 
   gap between front-end design and back-end logic, I aim to grow into a well-rounded developer 
   capable of building complete, end-to-end web applications.
