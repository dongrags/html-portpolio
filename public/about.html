<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
   Dhong Ragudo is an aspiring web developer with a passion for creating engaging, user-centric websites. Currently, he is dedicating his time and energy to honing his skills in the ever-evolving world of web development. Though relatively early in his journey, Dhong’s enthusiasm for design, layout, and user experience has already driven him to explore various front-end technologies and frameworks.

  Over the past months, Dhong has gained practical experience building and styling websites, focusing primarily on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. He has designed responsive interfaces, implemented interactive features, and optimized layouts for different devices—all while staying mindful of modern design principles. Although comfortable crafting the look and feel of a site, Dhong recognizes that his knowledge of back-end processes, server-side languages, and database management remains limited.

  Moving forward, Dhong’s goal is to deepen his understanding of the “behind-the-scenes” code that powers dynamic websites. He plans to explore back-end technologies such as Node.js or Python, learn how APIs function, and become familiar with database systems like MySQL or MongoDB. By bridging the gap between front-end design and back-end logic, Dhong aims to grow into a well-rounded developer capable of building complete, end-to-end web applications.
